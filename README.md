## Next.js Project with Emotion and Storybook
This project is built using Next.js for server-side rendering and Emotion for CSS-in-JS styling. Additionally, Storybook is integrated for creating and testing UI components in isolation. The project also includes a global reset, theming implementation, and typography management.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - A React framework for building fast, SEO-friendly applications with server-side rendering.
- **Emotion** - A powerful CSS-in-JS library used for styling components, offering both `styled` and `css` props for flexible styling approaches.
- **Storybook** - A tool for developing UI components in isolation, enabling consistent and reusable design.

##  Features
- Theming

Centralized theme configuration with customizable design tokens (colors, fonts, etc.) using ThemeProvider from Emotion.
- Typography

A standardized typography system for managing font sizes, weights, and styles across the application.
- Global Reset

CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across browsers.
- Component Development with Storybook

Storybook setup for creating, testing, and documenting UI components in isolation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
